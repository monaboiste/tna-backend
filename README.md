#### Backend Technology stack:
* JDK 11
* Gradle
* Spring Boot
* Spring Data JPA
* Spring Security
* JUnit
* Mockito
* PostgreSQL
* Liquibase

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
These of following must be installed on your local machine:  
 * JDK 11  
 * Docker and Docker-Compose  
 * Git  

### Clone
Clone repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/monaboiste/tna-system-backend.git
```  

### Set up environment variables
The variables listed in  the example below must be specified. 
The easiest way is set up ``.env`` file (supported by bootRun task): 
```sh
# Application
TNA_ADMIN_LOGIN=admin
TNA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin

# Database
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=tna
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
```
If you prefer to build and run the application using IntelliJ IDE, 
you might consider installing [EnvFile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile).

### Run
Start PostgreSQL:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Execute:  
```sh
./gradlew bootRun
```
System provides default in-memory ``$TNA_ADMIN_LOGIN`` user with password ``$TNA_ADMIN_PASSWORD``.

Gradle will build project and start Tomcat Server on your localhost. Base URL of Web Api: [http://localhost:8080/api](http://localhost:8080/api).

Generate sample data:  
To auto-generate sample data, run Spring Boot application as follows:
```sh
./gradlew bootRun \
    -Dspring.datasource.data="file:///$PWD/scripts/sample-data.sql" \
    -Dspring.datasource.initialization-mode=always \
    -Dspring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

Alternatively you can use bash scripts provided in ``scripts/`` directory:
```sh
./generate-employees.sh -u <username>:<password> -h <host_addr> # Generate some employee data
./generate-attendance-records.sh -u <username>:<password> -h <host_addr> # Generate attendance data
```

#### Tests
Run unit tests:
```sh
./gradlew test
```  
Run integration tests:
```sh
./gradlew integrationTest
```
